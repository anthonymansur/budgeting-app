# budgeting-app
Personal live project that is constantly being updated

This app was made using the MERN stack. 

How to use this app:

0. Go to (https://mansur-budgeting.herokuapp.com/).
1. Log into the app via Google or Facebook
2. Create wallets, each with specific percentages that determines how your income will be allocated (e.g. Having 
a "Personal" wallet with 50% of your income, a "Going Out" wallet for 30% and a "Savings" wallet for the 
remaining 20%).
3. Add your income (recommend the amount of money you currently have to begin, and then your paycheck for each
additional income recorded)
  - You will see how your income will be divided (e.g. If you followed the above example from step 2 and insert
    $1000, you will see your personal wallet with $500, your going out with $300, and your savings wallet at 
    $200.
4. Add any future expenses and specify which category that expense falls in (e.g. spend $10 on meals (personal)
and $20 going out to the movies (going out))
  - If you followed the above examples, you will now see your personal at $490 and your going out wallet at $280

Another cool feature is to integrate your debit/credit cards to the application using an API called Plaid 
(https://plaid.com/). Feel free to integrate up to 3 cards (more upon request). The benefit of integrating 
your card is that every time a new transaction is processed, the app will display this new transaction for you
to fill accept or deny and allocate to its specific wallet.

That is the main way to use the app. There are other features that are being added infrequently, for example the
goal page, which allows you to set a goal and a timeline for that goal to be met (and an additional option for 
the app to deduct money from a wallet on a daily basis for you to reach that goal).

Thanks for checking out the app! Feel free to contact me for any questions or comments at amansur99@gmail.com
